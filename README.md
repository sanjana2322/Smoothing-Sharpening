**Exp. 2-a** = Smoothing = Smoothing is a technique used in image editing to reduce noise or rough textures in an image. It helps to remove digital noise or grain, soften wrinkles and reduce texture in images. Smoothing filters, such as Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, and Average Blur, work by dividing the image into small sections, analyzing each pixel's value, and averaging it with neighboring pixels to produce a smoother image. By reducing the noise and texture, smoothing can make images appear softer and more subtle. However, over-smoothing can lead to a loss of detail, so it's essential to strike the right balance. 
**Exp. 2-b** = Sharpening = Sharpening is a technique used in image editing to enhance the details and textures in an image. It helps to enhance textures and patterns, improve image clarity and definition, and make images appear more vibrant and detailed. Sharpening filters, such as Unsharp Mask, Smart Sharpen, and High Pass Sharpen, work by analyzing the image for high-frequency details, amplifying these details by increasing the contrast between pixels, and producing a sharper image. By enhancing the details and textures, sharpening can make images appear more vivid and engaging. However, over-sharpening can lead to unnatural-looking results, so it's crucial to experiment with different filters and settings to find the best results for your image.
